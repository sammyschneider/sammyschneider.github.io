Project #1: Lyrics App

Functionality: 
Utilized 2 API's to create a website where the user can input an Artist name and it will populate 10 songs. The         limitation to the first API I used (Genius API) is that for the free version only certain songs can be returned as      well as a certain number (10). Once the songs generate, the user can then click on one of the songs for a modal to    appear that references the second API I used (APISeeds) which returns the song lyrics to that respective song. Again, this API is free so has some limited functionality which includes not being able to pull every single song  title request for lyrics. 


Technologies used: 
JS, HTML, CSS, Jquery, AJAX, JSON

Approach taken:
My approach was that I kept my end goal (seeing song lyrics) in mind while making the framework. I tried to research which API's were free an available to achieve this. I could not find any "free" API's from which I could pull data so I decided to use and implement two separate APIs. Ended up finding an API that could populate song titles based on userInput as well as an API that could generate song lyrics to a specific song. 

Unsolved problems: 
Hardest part for me was design of the site (CSS) in terms of looks as well as media queries. 
This app could be easily added on to by adding possibly a play song button next to each song title. I am assuming this would need a third API.
